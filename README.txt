Welcome to "Create Your Own CYOA"!
CYOA is "Choose Your Own Adventure". 

Information about this package:

1. Start by playing the story to see the capabilities of this CYOA program first-hand. Open up the CHIP folder and run chip.exe. 
chip.exe is the executable file version of this story. The .dll files are present so that the .exe can execute. 

Alternatively, if you have the SWI-Prolog compiler installed, you can open the Sample.pl file to play the game. The KB_ENG.pl, the KB_ESP.pl, the KB_ITA.pl are the knowledge base files for the story.

2. Next, look at User_Guide.html to see how you can make your own CYOA. This will walk you through how you can use Shell.pl and Shell_KB.pl as templates to code your own CYOA. 

3. Information on the GNU General Public License is on the GNU General Public License.txt file. 

Happy playing!
