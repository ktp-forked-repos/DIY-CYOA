'\"I just want to be a wild animal. I want to roam and be free. The world is my perch, which I with claws will grasp...,\" Chip mumbles to herself. She sits preening her feathers and looking through the window at the bright sky outside the research facility. \n

Karen, the laboratory\'s principal investigator, overhears only the last sentence. \n 
\"Aren\'t you a smart bird!\" she exclaims. \"You\'ve made your own original modification of the quote from \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", a Shakespeare play.\" Her face glows with excitement. \n 

\"The world\'s mine oyster. \n
Which I with sword will open," she quotes the original. \n
Karen always keeps a notepad in her pocket. She takes it out and scribbles down the observation, then exits Chip\'s room. \n

'Chip sighs. \n 
\"Yes, I am a smart bird. That\'s exactly all they care about,\" she thinks to herself. \n
She had learned of her purpose and the reason for her creation slowly, piece-meal, as she grew older and became ever smarter and curious. Her creation was an inevitable result of the progression and merging of the fields of chimerics and animal behavior. Scientists were learning that many animals possessed an intelligence potential as great as that of humanity. But, quirks of anatomy and lifestyle hampered intelligent expression. Without specialized vocal cords or opposable thumbs, an intelligent bear couldn\'t recite speeches or write poetry- and when mere survival required fishing all day, when would he have time? There were also, of course, practical limits on brain matter. A mouse could never be as smart as a human for the mere fact that sufficient neurons couldn\'t be squeezed into the 400 mg of brain matter a mouse possessed.\n
	The animal behaviorists discovered that nature\'s children contained a lot of potential, but many obstacles prevented them from utilizing it. The chimerists thought they could fix that problem.\n

story(b1, 
'\"You see, there are birds\", Karen had told Chip. Birds vexed the neuron problem for reasons no one could understand. African Grey parrots possessed brains the size of walnuts yet the intellectual capacity of four-year-olds. \n
	\"And best of all, there are ravens.\"\n

	Scientists wanted to see if they could surpass the intellectual limitations of animals using chimeric technology. Ravens were the ideal subject. Their syrinx could produce human speech. They could use their beaks and feet to manipulate tools. Parrots could do the same things, but unlike parrots, ravens were passerines- that is, songbirds. It was only in songbirds that adult neuron generation had ever been observed. In the winter, neurons atrophied and died but in summer, they multipled to cope with the additional neurological load of learning new songs to defend breeding territories. Because of that, only in passerines could human neurons be added and multiplied. As additional icing on the cake: ravens were an unprotected species under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Even the paperwork to use them in research was minimal. \n

'\"My parents were one wild-caught raven from the fields and a discarded human embryo from in-vitro fertilization,\" Chip murmurs to herself as she remembers. \"That is why my name is Chip: Corvid Hominid Intelligence Project. Even my name is nothing but an acronym for their science,\" she reflects darkly. \n 

	\"Creating a chimera was trivial,\" Karen had said. \"It wasn\'t technologically difficult to insert human neurons in the brain of a raven embryo. There were other modifications we had to do, of course. You\'re much bigger than the two kilogram, sixty centimeter raven found in the wild. You\'re as big as a turkey. Thankfully you can still fly despite the enlargement. This is for practical reasons; you understand, yes? Of course we needed you to have a bigger brain than what a normal raven would have if you were to be much more intelligent than they are. But your modifications were for the public, too. They\'re terrified of you escaping. Birds as smart as people flying around, it\'s a public relations nightmare. So if you were to escape- well, it\'d be obvious right away that you\'re unnatural. So don\'t ever think of trying.\" \n

'It wasn\'t that the scientists treated her poorly- in fact, it was to the contrary. They gave her anything she wanted. She had tasted exotic fruits and gourmet dishes from around the world. When she was younger, they would bring her catalogues of toys and she would spend hours circling all the items she wanted. They bought her every single one. They provided tutors to teach her anything she wished. Once she had expressed an interest in learning Latin and they brought her a tutor straight from the Vatican. No, they did not mistreat her. But she was unsatisfied. \n

She hated living a life for their purposes. Her name explained it all; all that she was to them was a project with a specific purpose. She had never been able to define her own life. Her purpose? Be a good experiment, learn lots of things, and show the world how smart you are. That way, Karen could publish more papers, get more grants, be awarded more prizes, and finally retire with having had a productive career. Chip was nothing but an instrument. If she were free, she could live her life with any purpose that she chose. She could even live as a dumb raven, even.\n

While Karen and Alice sat in chairs, Chip had her own special perch on which to sit. While the others drank tea or sodas, Chip had her own special bottled water to drink. Drinking other bottled waters or even water from the faucet had always been explicitly forbidden for her entire life. Many times she had asked, "Why?", and the answer was always the same.\n
	"You need special nutrients in your water and any other water will make you sick. Now, drink," Karen had always replied. But Chip had figured out that Karen was simply being paranoid. When not under Karen\'s watchful gaze, she had snuck sips of tap water and drank from puddles in her outdoor enclosure many times and had never gotten sick. Karen was simply overprotective of her most prized experiment, Chip had concluded.\n

"Isn\'t that dangerous? Couldn\'t the bacteria escape and make people sick?" Chip asks.\n 
"Not at all," Alice replies. "We genetically engineered the bacteria to have a "killswitch", so to speak. The unaltered, wild-type forms of the bacteria are capable of synthesizing most of their required nutrients. Our genetically engineered strains lacked that capability and needed those nutrients supplemented in their media. If they escaped, they died."\n

It was too far away to touch unless she were to surpass the inner layer.\n 
"That must be the killswitch," Chip muses to herself. "The outer layer of fencing has a much higher voltage than the inner- it must be a lethal amount of voltage."\n 
This becomes more and more logical the more she thinks about it. If both layers were the same voltage, she could surely ignore the shocks- nasty, but barely tolerable- of both fences and snip her way through them anyway. A high-voltage outer layer would be necessary.\n

Her first day of freedom is nice. She finds a happiness she has never felt before in her entire life. She lives off the land, off her own wits, and has no goals or expectations other than the daily needs of survival. She can enjoy the sun on her feathers and the wind rushing by her face. \n 

Night falls and she finds a tall tree in a park to sleep in. She sleeps soundly. \n 
Action: \n 
t1. Time to wake up for your second day of freedom!

'Chip wakes up at dawn the next day. Despite sleeping so well the entire night, she wakes up feeling weary. \n 
"It is from all the flying I did yesterday, more flying than I\'ve done in my life," she concludes. \n 
She is ready to get back to traveling and takes off right away. But soon into her flight she feels different. Her heart is pounding, her breathing is ragged. She feels exhausted despite flying for such little time.\n 
"Why do I feel this way?" she asks herself, concerned. She wants to continue but finds it too difficult. Every wing beat comes with tinge of pain and the wind buffeting her suddenly feels like an impossible obstacle. \n 
Action: \n 
u1. You decide to land.

story(u1, 
'She makes a sloppy landing in a tree, surprised to discover that her balance is off and almost missing the branch. Huffing and puffing, she tries preening her feathers to calm herself. But when she grasps a breast feather in her beak, to her surprise it comes away. She grabs another feather and another, and they all come away at her touch. Her heart pounds harder.\n 

"What is happening to me?" she thinks to herself in a panic. \n 
She recalls every event of the day before. Did she eat or drink something bad, something poisonous? She had been very careful in what she had consumed because she knew her immune system was sensitive, having been raised in captivity. Even more than that- she knew what the symptoms of contaminated food or water would be, and they wouldn\'t be what she was experiencing. In fact, she knew nothing that would cause what she was experiencing. \n 

Her head is spinning. Perching is hard and taking too much of her concentration. Sitting on the ground would be better. She tries fluttering gently down, but she cannot muster the strength to flap her wings sufficiently or control her tail feathers. She ends up ungracefully tumbling down. She feels a rumble in her throat and coughs. Out comes a few drops of blood. \n 

Action: \n 
v1. Why is this happening?

story(v1,
'She thinks even harder. What about the day before yesterday, in the lab?\n 
 She thinks about the morning\'s lessons and activities, listening to music, going off to dinner, and the new scientist, Alice, that joined the team. She barely knew anything about Alice. During dinner she had blasted questions at Alice so she could disguse her poor appetite. Alice had talked about her undergraduate research...killswitch. Karen and Alice talked about the killswitch in Karen\'s office, too. Karen had told Alice she had a killswitch installed so Chip could never survive an escape. Chip had outsmarted the killswitch, turned off the electricity and cut through the fence. Freedom. But no pursuit. Killswitch. Bacteria engineered to need a specific nutrient broth so that if they escaped, they died. Their killswitch. The electric fence. But Chip had always drank a special bottled water her entire life. It has nutrients, Karen had told her. She had drank other water sometimes and never gotten sick. But she still had always drank the bottled water. Killswitch. The nutrients...if they escaped, they died. If they escaped, they died.\n 

"The killswitch wasn\'t the fence," Chip realizes. "It\'s me. I am the killswitch. My special water had the nutrients I need. Without it, I die. No one pursued me because they knew I would die."\n 

She belts out a hoarse croak of sorrow as her world fades to black.\n
